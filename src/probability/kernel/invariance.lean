# Invariance of measures along a kernel

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

We define the push-forward of a measure along a kernel which results in another measure. In the
case that the push-forward measure is the same as the original measure, we say that the measure is
invariant with respect to the kernel.

## Main definitions

* `probability_theory.kernel.map_measure`: the push-forward of a measure along a kernel.
* `probability_theory.kernel.invariant`: invariance of a given measure with respect to a kernel.

## Useful lemmas

* `probability_theory.kernel.comp_apply_eq_map_measure`,
  `probability_theory.kernel.const_map_measure_eq_comp_const`, and
  `probability_theory.kernel.comp_const_apply_eq_map_measure` established the relationship between
  the push-forward measure and the composition of kernels.
