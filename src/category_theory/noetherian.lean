# Artinian and noetherian categories

An artinian category is a category in which objects do not
have infinite decreasing sequences of subobjects.

A noetherian category is a category in which objects do not
have infinite increasing sequences of subobjects.

We show that any nonzero artinian object has a simple subobject.

## Future work
The Jordan-Hölder theorem, following https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0FCK.
