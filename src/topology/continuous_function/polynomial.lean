# Constructions relating polynomial functions and continuous functions.

This file is just a stub at the moment, but will grow with subsequent PRs
giving abstract statements of the Weierstrass approximation theorem,
and the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

/--
Every polynomial with coefficients in a topological semiring gives a (bundled) continuous function.

⟨λ x : R, p.eval x, by continuity⟩

/--
A polynomial as a continuous function,
with domain restricted to some subset of the semiring of coefficients.

(This is particularly useful when restricting to compact sets, e.g. `[0,1]`.)
